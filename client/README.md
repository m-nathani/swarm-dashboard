## `Docker Swarm Dashboard Client`
> Dashboard for Docker Swarm.

### Setup
```bash
  # change the current directory
  λ cd 'swarm-dashboard/client'
  # install all dependencies
  λ npm install
  # run the client
  λ npm start
```


### Proxy
```bash
  # On Port: 4000
  The key to use an Koa backend with a project created with `react-app` is on using a **proxy**. We have a _proxy_ entry in `client/package.json`
```
